# Magic Link 404 Error - Deployment Fix Guide

## âœ… VERCEL.JSON UPDATED

The `vercel.json` file has been updated with the following critical changes:

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **SPA Fallback Rewrite**: Added rewrite rule to serve `index.html` for all non-API routes
2. **Functions Configuration**: Added Node.js runtime configuration
3. **Clean URLs**: Enabled clean URLs and disabled trailing slashes
4. **Netlify Compatibility**: Created `public/_redirects` file

### **New Rewrite Rule:**
```json
{
  "source": "/((?!api/).*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}
```

This ensures that all routes (like `/accept-invitation`) are handled by the React app.

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **1. Deploy the Updated Configuration**

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel deploy --prod

# Or if using other platforms, upload the dist/ folder
```

### **2. Configure Supabase Dashboard (CRITICAL)**

**You MUST configure these in your Supabase Dashboard:**

#### **2.1 Redirect URLs**
Go to: **Authentication â†’ URL Configuration**

Add these URLs to **Redirect URLs**:
```
http://localhost:3000/accept-invitation
https://demo.alphabusinessdesigns.co.in/accept-invitation
https://demo.alphabusinessdesigns.co.in/auth/callback
```

#### **2.2 Site URL**
Set **Site URL** to:
```
https://demo.alphabusinessdesigns.co.in
```

#### **2.3 Email Templates**
Go to: **Authentication â†’ Email Templates**

Update **"Invite user"** template to use:
```html
<a href="{{ .RedirectTo }}">Accept Invitation</a>
```

### **3. Test the Fix**

1. **Test Direct URL**: Visit `https://demo.alphabusinessdesigns.co.in/accept-invitation`
2. **Test Magic Link**: Create a test invitation and click the link
3. **Verify No 404**: The page should load instead of showing 404

## ðŸ”§ WHAT WAS FIXED

### **Root Cause:**
The 404 error occurred because:
- React Router handles client-side routing
- Server didn't know about routes like `/accept-invitation`
- No fallback to `index.html` for unknown routes

### **Solution:**
- Added SPA fallback rewrite rule
- All unknown routes now serve `index.html`
- React Router can then handle the routing client-side

## ðŸ“‹ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] `vercel.json` updated with SPA fallback
- [ ] `public/_redirects` file created
- [ ] Application deployed to production
- [ ] Supabase redirect URLs configured
- [ ] Supabase site URL set correctly
- [ ] Email templates updated
- [ ] Direct URL test: `/accept-invitation` works
- [ ] Magic link test: Full flow works

## ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED RESULT

After deployment:
- âœ… Magic links redirect to `/accept-invitation` successfully
- âœ… Users can complete account setup
- âœ… Users redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role
- âœ… No more 404 errors

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

1. **Deploy immediately** - The configuration is ready
2. **Configure Supabase** - This is essential for magic links to work
3. **Test thoroughly** - Verify the complete flow works

The magic link 404 error should now be completely resolved!
