Individual user spaces where clients can set up their review links.
A filtering system for clients based on ratings and redirection to Google reviews.
Please provide:

A structured plan detailing the development phases of this platform.
Best practices and resources for each feature listed above.
A prioritization strategy for deliverables to ensure timely approval and implementation.
Focus on practical, actionable guidance rooted in existing documentation and case studies.
ChatGPT said:
To tailor a structured development plan and guidance for your Review Management SaaS platform in Supabase, could you please clarify:

What frontend framework or technology stack (e.g., React, Next.js, Vue) are you planning to use?

Will this be a multi-tenant SaaS where each client has their own isolated environment?

Do you have a preferred authentication method (e.g., Supabase Auth, third-party SSO)?

Are you planning on supporting any integrations besides Google Reviews (like Yelp, Trustpilot, etc.)?

What is your expected timeline or deadline for the first working MVP?

This will help me craft a realistic, detailed development roadmap and prioritize features accordingly.

Development Plan for Supabase Review Management SaaS

Review Management SaaS Platform Development Plan
1. Core Setup & Multi-Tenancy
Database & RLS schema: Start by designing a multi-tenant schema. Create an accounts (tenants) table and add a tenant_id FK on each data table (e.g. reviews). Enable Row-Level Security (RLS) on all exposed tables
supabase.com
. Write RLS policies that filter rows by the user’s tenant claim. For example, use a policy like USING (tenant_id = current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'tenant_id')
antstack.com
. This ensures every client only sees their own data. Follow Supabase’s RLS guide for syntax and examples
supabase.com
antstack.com
.
Supabase Auth configuration: Initialize Supabase Auth in your React/Vite app. Configure the authentication flow (magic links or Google OAuth). In the Supabase Dashboard under Auth → Email Templates, customize the “Magic Link” and “Invite User” email templates with your branding and any custom text
supabase.com
. This lets you send tailored invites and magic-link emails to managers and clients.
Auth Hooks / Triggers: To automatically assign tenant_id to new users, use a Postgres Auth Hook or table trigger. For instance, a “Before User Created” hook can inject extra data or custom claims into the user’s JWT
supabase.com
. Alternatively, add a trigger on auth.users that reads new.raw_user_meta_data->>'tenant_id' (passed in via invite/sign-up) and inserts a row in a members table linking user_id to tenant_id. Either way, ensure the JWT (or user row) carries the correct tenant identifier so RLS policies work.
2. Authentication & User Flows
User Invitation & Signup: Implement inviting team members via the master dashboard. Use supabase.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail(email, options)
supabase.com
 from your admin UI or backend. You can pass extra metadata in options.data (e.g. tenant_id) so the invited user is tied to the correct tenant. Note: there is a known issue with invite payloads not populating user_metadata
github.com
; if it occurs, consider using a DB trigger or hook to record the metadata. After invitation, the user completes sign-up via the magic link. Customize the magic-link behavior (redirect URL, email content) in Auth settings
supabase.com
 so users have a smooth experience.
Assigning Tenant ID: Ensure that whenever a user signs up (self-registered or via invite), you record their tenant_id. Best practice: include the tenant in user_metadata at sign-up/invite, then in a BEFORE INSERT trigger on auth.users insert that into your members or profiles table. This links the new user to the correct account. RLS policies can then check the JWT or the joined table to enforce data isolation
antstack.com
. (For example, see a community implementation where the before insert trigger copies raw_user_meta_data->>'instance_id' into tenant tables
antstack.com
.)
Role Management: Use user/app metadata or a roles table to manage roles (e.g. “manager” vs “user”). For instance, set app_metadata.role: 'manager' via updateUserById()
supabase.com
 or a custom claim. Then write RLS policies keyed off that role. Always apply least-privilege: e.g. only managers see cross-tenant views. Supabase’s RLS examples (like USING (auth.uid() = user_id)) apply here by substituting tenant_id
supabase.com
antstack.com
.
3. Master Dashboard & Admin Controls
Invite & User List: Build pages for the super-admin/manager to invite and list users. Use Supabase Admin APIs on the backend:
Invite: call supabase.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail() to send invites (as noted)
supabase.com
.
List Users: use supabase.auth.admin.listUsers() to fetch all users (paged) for admin display.
View/Update: for each user, call supabase.auth.admin.getUserById() and updateUserById()
supabase.com
. You can update email, user_metadata, or app_metadata fields (e.g. change roles or reset password).
Suspend/Delete: To suspend, one approach is to add a flag (e.g. disabled: true) in app_metadata or your own table and enforce it via RLS (no DB row returned). Supabase’s updateUserById() can set email_confirm: true or change metadata
supabase.com
; to fully remove a user, call supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(id).
Account Management: Allow managers to promote a user’s role (e.g. add 'manager' in their metadata via the admin API) and to revoke access. Record these changes in your own audit log (see next).
Audit Logging: Keep an audit trail of administrative actions. You can use Supabase’s built-in Logs Explorer (Logflare) to monitor Auth events and SQL queries
supabase.com
. For custom logs, create an admin_logs table: insert a row via an Edge Function or Postgres trigger whenever critical actions occur (e.g. user invite, role change).
Tenant Usage Metrics: Track each tenant’s usage (e.g. number of active users or review requests). Supabase’s project-level analytics show MAUs by default
supabase.com
, but you may want tenant-level counts. Implement a query or periodic job that counts distinct users per tenant_id from Auth logs or from your members table. Also record business-specific events (e.g. number of reviews queried) in a metrics table if needed.
4. Client Spaces & Review Link Setup
Isolated Client Dashboards: Each client (tenant) should have a private dashboard. In practice, you’ll create React routes/components guarded by Supabase Auth, and rely on RLS so that any queries only return that client’s data
supabase.com
antstack.com
. For example, each client can have a “Settings” page to manage their review link. Use a reviews or properties table with columns (tenant_id, name, google_place_id, review_url, etc.). Enforce in RLS: USING (tenant_id = auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata' ->> 'tenant_id').
A typical user profile page (from Supabase’s React tutorial) is shown below. In your app, the analogous page would let the client input their Google Review link or Place ID, and perhaps an uploaded logo. RLS ensures they only see and edit their own entry
supabase.com
.
Review Link Configuration: Provide UI fields for clients to enter their Google Business Place ID or direct review URL. (The Google Place ID can be found via the Google Place ID Finder.) Store that in your DB. You might also include a “Link to Reviews” button that opens the Google Maps reviews page (constructed using the Place ID). Libraries like react-google-reviews show how to display average rating and link to the business profile
github.com
.
Profile Example: The embedded image above is a user-edit form from a Supabase example
supabase.com
. Use similar form components (e.g. avatar upload, text fields) for your client settings page. This ensures each client feels they have an “account” (profile + review link) without accessing others’ data.
5. Google Reviews Integration & Filtering
Fetching Reviews: To display/filter reviews, integrate with Google’s APIs. For up-to-5 reviews, the Google Places JavaScript API can load reviews client-side. For example, using the Maps JS library’s Place object:
const place = new google.maps.places.Place({ id: PLACE_ID });
await place.fetchFields({ fields: ['displayName','reviews'] });
const reviews = place.reviews || [];
This retrieves reviews (limit ~5) for the business
developers.google.com
. Alternatively, for comprehensive data, use the Google Business Profile API’s accounts.locations.reviews.list endpoint
developers.google.com
. That requires OAuth credentials but returns all reviews for a location.
Filtering Logic: Google’s APIs do not have built-in rating filters, so apply filtering in your app. For instance, once you have a reviews array, use something like filtered = reviews.filter(r => r.starRating >= 4). Present UI controls (checkboxes or dropdown) so clients can show reviews of certain star ratings only.
UI for Reviews: In the React client page, display reviews in a list or carousel. You can use components (or custom code) to show reviewer name, comment, date, and rating. The react-google-reviews library (as an example) provides customizable layouts (carousel, badge) and automatically includes a link to the Google profile
github.com
. The “badge” layout shows the average rating and links to the Google Business profile for leaving new reviews. Use that or build your own “Write a Review” button using the Place ID’s Google Maps link.
Redirecting to Google: For “Leave a review” actions, redirect clients to the Google Maps review page (constructed as https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=PLACE_ID) or similar. This encourages customers to post on Google. In short, store the Place ID and either use an embedded widget or simply link out.
6. Prioritization & Timeline
Phase 1 – Foundations (Hours 1–2): Implement the multi-tenant schema and enable RLS. Configure Supabase Auth (magic link/Google) and test sign-up flows in a dev environment. Customize email templates
supabase.com
. Verify that signing up users are isolated by tenant.
Phase 2 – Auth Flows & Roles (Hours 2–3): Build invitation logic and user onboarding. Use inviteUserByEmail() and handle new-user triggers to attach tenant IDs. Create UI/forms for managers to set roles. Ensure RLS policies correctly enforce roles/tenants
antstack.com
supabase.com
.
Phase 3 – Admin Dashboard (Hours 3–5): Develop the manager/master dashboard pages. Include user listing, invite form, and user detail view. Hook up Supabase Admin APIs: list, update, delete users
supabase.com
supabase.com
. Test suspend/role-change flows. Log these actions (e.g., to an admin_logs table).
Phase 4 – Client Dashboard (Hours 5–6): Implement the client-side space. Create a protected React route where clients manage their “profile” and review link. Use RLS so only their data is shown
supabase.com
antstack.com
. Build forms for entering the Google Place ID or review URL.
Phase 5 – Review Integration (Hours 6–7): Add the Google reviews feature. Write a component/function to fetch reviews using the Places API or Business Profile API
developers.google.com
developers.google.com
. Add client-side filters (checkboxes or sliders) to filter by star rating. Add a “Leave a review” link/button to open the Google review page (use a component or simple anchor).
Phase 6 – Testing & Polish (Remaining time): Thoroughly test each flow. Ensure RLS rules prevent any cross-tenant data leaks. Test email sending (invites, magic links) and tailor as needed. Confirm logging and monitoring are set. Finally, prepare deployment (build React with Vite and configure Supabase project settings for production).
Resources & Best Practices: Throughout development, lean on Supabase’s docs and examples. The official React user-management tutorial shows how to initialize Supabase and use RLS
supabase.com
. Refer to the RLS guide for writing policies
supabase.com
. For Google APIs, Google’s developer guides cover fetching reviews
developers.google.com
 and best practices. Following these references and iterating in prioritized sprints will ensure timely delivery and approval. Sources: Official Supabase documentation and examples
